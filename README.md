## Reason

- Bootstrap
  
  - **easy** to learn and use
    
  - it is built with **mobile**-first design principles, which means that it is optimized for smaller screens and touch-based interactions
    
  - it is **compatible** with a wide variety of web browsers and devices
    
  - it is not too **Powerful, like a framework,** but provide convenience building the fron-end
    
- jQuery
  
  - it provides a wide range of built-in methods to manipulate Document Object Model (**DOM**)
    
  - it is easy to handle events, and make **AJAX** requests
    
  - it is **compatible** with a wide variety of web browsers and devices
    
- ejs
  
  - it works as a **template render engine**, provides a simple and intuitive syntax for embedding JavaScript code in HTML templates
    
  - it is lightweight and **fast**, which makes it suitable for use in small to medium-sized web application like this project
    
- Element UI
  
  - it provides a wide range of pre-designed UI **components**, such as buttons, forms, tables, and more, which can be easily integrated into a web application
    
  - the components are designed to be lightweight, fast, and **responsive**, with a consistent look and feel across all platforms
    
  - it provides a comprehensive set of development tools and documentation, which makes it **easy** to learn and use
    
  - also, it is not too **Powerful, like a framework**, but also provides components
    
- JWT
  
  - JWT can be used for both **authentication and authorization**, which means it can be used to identify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform
    
  - it's also **easy** to implement and provides a secure way to transmit data across different systems
    
- crypto-js
  
  - it provides a wide range of **cryptographic** algorithms, including encryption, decryption, hashing, and signing, which can be used to secure data in web applications
    
  - it is easy to use and implement, with a **simple**, intuitive syntax that makes it accessible to developers of all skill levels
    
- MongoDB(Mongoose)
  
  - it is a popular **NoSQL** database that is well-suited for storing and querying large amounts of unstructured data
  - it is a **document-based database**, which means that it stores data in semi-structured format, allowing for more flexible and dynamic data modeling
  - it allows for **easy validation** and type casting of model properties
- socket.io
  
  - it is a popular JavaScript library that allows for **real-time**, bidirectional communication between a client and server
    
  - it allows for **easy broadcast** of events to multiple clients, which can be useful for building real-time notifications or chat applications
    
- Morgan?
  
  - it is a popular HTTP request **logger middleware** for Node.js
    
  - it is **simple** to use and provides a consistent API for logging request and response information
    
  - it can automatically capture and log **request-response cycle time**, which can be useful for debugging and performance analysis
    
- Jest
  
  - it is **easy** to set up and use, and it requires minimal configuration to get started
    
  - it has a powerful **assertion** library built-in, which makes it easy to write **tests** and make assertions about the expected behavior of your code
    
  - it has a built-in test runner, which can **automatically** discover and run your tests, and provides a detailed test report
    
- Postman
  
  - it provides a **simple** and intuitive user interface for crafting and **testing API requests**
    
  - it supports a **wide range of request types**, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc
    
  - it has built-in support for **testing and validating** API responses, which can help you catch errors and ensure that your API is working as expected
    
- Selenium
  
  - it is a popular open-source suite of tools for automating web browsers ,which allows for **automating user interactions** with a web page, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating between pages
    
  - It allows for **testing web applications** across different platforms and browsers, which can help ensure that your application is compatible with a wide range of user configurations
